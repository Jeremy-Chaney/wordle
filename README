This is a python-based version of Wordle
This version uses a seeded pseudo-random number generator to come up with a new word from over 2.3k possible words.
Unlike the web-based version, the answer dictionary is stored in alphabetical order instead of a day-by-day list which is easy to cheat.

If you want to make a version of this for yourself, I recommend using the word dictionaries from this wordle_word_dict.py

Multiplayer over WiFi now supported!
    Run "wordle.py -h" for more information.

### Rules of Wordle ###
-   You must guess a 5 letter word in 6 or fewer guesses
-   Your guesses must be a word in the dictionary of valid words (there are almost 13k valid words)
-   You will get feedback after each valid guess:
    1. a correct letter in the correct spot will appear green
    2. a correct letter in the wrong spot will appear yellow
    3. a letter that does not appear in the final word will appear grey
